JS:       Memory Heap, Call Stack -> v8 engine
Web APIs: DOM (document) -> provided by browsers
AJAX:     (XMLHttpRequest) -> 
Timeout:  (setTimeout)
event loop, callbackQue

Javascript has single call stack and able to do only one thing at one time
Call Stack - is a data structure, the top line of what says where at the program we are

So for example:
function fnA(){}
function fnB(){ fnA(); }

the Call Stack state will be:
1 step -> fnB
2 step -> fnB,fnA
3 step -> fnB
4 step -> nothing
